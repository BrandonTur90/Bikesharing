# Bikesharing


## Overview
In this project I was tasked with analyzing metadata from Citi Bike, a bike sharing business, from
their operations in New York City from August 2019. Using this data, I made a tableau story to 
create predictions for the viability of a bike sharing start-up in Des Moines, and answer
a few specific questions:

1) Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2) Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3) Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results

![Slide 1](https://github.com/HexHaunter/Bikesharing/blob/main/images/Slide%201.PNG?raw=true)
In August of 2019 there were a total of 2,344,224 trips made by users. 
A large majority of users were Subscribers as opposed to customers.
Peak usage was in the late afternoon to early evening.

![slide2](https://github.com/HexHaunter/Bikesharing/blob/main/images/Slide%202.PNG?raw=true)
Users are fairly consistent throughout the work week, with Thursday evening being
the most popular time. Wednesday is the least popular day for users, perhaps wanting
to use that as a day to take a break from biking.

![slide3](https://github.com/HexHaunter/Bikesharing/blob/main/images/Slide%203.PNG?raw=true)
Most users only take short trips, 5 minutes being the most common trip duration.

![slide4](https://github.com/HexHaunter/Bikesharing/blob/main/images/Slide%204.PNG?raw=true)
Men checkout bikes more often than other genders, but their trip duration is very much
in line with the average.

Men also make up the majority of subscribers.


## Summary

Citi Bike is very popular with over 2.3 million trips, and has a high number of users, with most
being subscribers as opposed to customers. From the short trip duration, and the peak times of
use, it would appear that users use Citi Bike as a quick means of transport to work. With all
these factors combined, it would seem that a bike sharing start-up is a good business venture
in any metropolitan area. 

## Future Visualizations

Two additional visualizations are cross referencing the starting and ending locations based on
user type. In these two visualizations you can see that the customer dominant areas are around 
Central Park and the water, whereas subscribers dominate the rest of the map, strengthening the 
conclusion that many subscribers use Citi Bike as a means to get to work.
